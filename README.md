# leaf-growth
21/04/2024: This repository should be cleaned up and commented on in the space of a few months. 
A few instances of a model reproducing leaf growth, using a front propagation method.

**One way growth** 
contains two notebooks relative to the unidirectional growth model:
- finger_sinus.ipynb allows you to reproduce the finger growth
- stationary_form.ipynb explores the theoritical shape of the finger, as well as the iterated function

**Vein dependant growth**
- the file 'data' which contains a file 'angle', itself containing two fronts in a .h5 format
- src contains two files with functions imported in the notebooks
- notebooks presents two example of vein dependant growth 'angle_center' and 'angle_vertical'

**Wood**
cambium_summation.ipynb is an example of the angle summation method de delete loops, and mimick the growth the cambium after a wound
